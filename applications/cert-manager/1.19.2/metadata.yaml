overview: |
  cert-manager is a native Kubernetes certificate management controller. It can help with 
  issuing certificates from a variety of sources, such as Let's Encrypt, HashiCorp Vault, 
  Venafi, a simple signing key pair, or self signed. It ensures certificates are valid and 
  up to date, and attempts to renew certificates at a configured time before expiry.
