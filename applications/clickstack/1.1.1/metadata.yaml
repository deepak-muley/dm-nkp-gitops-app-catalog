overview: |
  **What it is** — ClickStack is a production-grade observability platform built on ClickHouse, unifying logs, traces, metrics, and sessions in a single high-performance solution. It enables developers and SREs to correlate and search observability data end-to-end without switching tools.

  **Highlights**
  - Correlate and search logs, metrics, session replays, and traces in one place
  - HyperDX UI with full-text and property search (e.g. level:err), SQL optional
  - OpenTelemetry (OTel) supported out of the box; schema-agnostic on your ClickHouse schema
  - Sub-second queries and high-cardinality workloads via ClickHouse columnar engine
  - Alerts, dashboards, live tail, and event deltas for anomaly detection
  - Open source; can be self-managed or used with ClickHouse Cloud
