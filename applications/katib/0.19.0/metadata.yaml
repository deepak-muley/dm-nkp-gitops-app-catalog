overview: |
  **What it is** — Katib is the Kubeflow project for automated hyperparameter tuning and neural architecture search (NAS) on Kubernetes, so you can optimize model training without manual trial-and-error.

  **Highlights**
  - Distributed hyperparameter tuning with multiple search algorithms (e.g. Bayesian, grid, random)
  - Neural architecture search; supports PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, and more
  - Kubernetes CRDs (Experiment, Trial) for GitOps and integration with ML pipelines
  - Part of the Kubeflow ecosystem; works with KServe and training operators
