overview: |
  **What it is** — Kyverno lets you enforce security and compliance on Kubernetes by writing policies as CRDs: validate, mutate, or generate resources based on rules you define.

  **Highlights**
  - Policies as Kubernetes YAML; validate, mutate, and generate resources
  - Image verification and attestation; context-aware rules (e.g. other resources, API)
  - CNCF project; often used with Gatekeeper for policy enforcement on NKP
