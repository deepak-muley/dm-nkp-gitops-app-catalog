  A2A (Agent-to-Agent) and MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for NKP GitOps 
  infrastructure monitoring and debugging. Provides AI assistants (Cursor, Claude, 
  VS Code Copilot) with tools to query GitOps status, debug Flux reconciliation 
  failures, check CAPI cluster health, monitor application deployments, and 
  check Gatekeeper/Kyverno policy violations.
  
  Features:
  - Full A2A protocol support with agent discovery (/.well-known/agent.json)
  - MCP tool invocation over HTTP
  - 15+ built-in tools for Flux CD, CAPI, Kommander monitoring
  - Two deployment modes: Traditional (Deployment) or K8s-Native (MCPServer CRD)
  - Enterprise-ready: HA, autoscaling, network policies, metrics
  
  Dependencies (install in order):
  1. cert-manager - for TLS certificate management (required)
  2. letsencrypt-clusterissuer - for Let's Encrypt certificates (optional)
  3. traefik - for Gateway API HTTPRoute ingress (required)
  4. kagent - for K8s-native MCPServer CRD deployment (optional, recommended for production)
  5. kube-prometheus-stack - for Prometheus metrics scraping (optional)
  
  Note: Set deploymentMode=mcpserver in values to use Kagent MCPServer CRD (enterprise recommended).
  When using MCPServer mode, ensure kagent is installed first.

overview: |
  dm-nkp-gitops-a2a-server is an AI agent server that enables AI assistants to 
  monitor and debug NKP GitOps infrastructure. It exposes tools via the A2A 
  (Agent-to-Agent) and MCP (Model Context Protocol) standards, allowing AI 
  agents to query Flux CD Kustomizations, GitRepositories, HelmReleases, 
  CAPI clusters/machines, Kommander Apps, and policy violations.
  
  The server integrates with Traefik Gateway API for HTTPS ingress and 
  cert-manager for automatic TLS certificates. Optionally exposes Prometheus 
  metrics for monitoring. Supports two deployment modes: traditional Kubernetes 
  Deployment or Kagent MCPServer CRD for K8s-native management.
