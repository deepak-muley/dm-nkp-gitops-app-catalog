description: |
  KubeArmor is a cloud-native runtime security enforcement system that restricts
  the behavior of pods, containers, and nodes at the system level. It enforces
  policies on process execution, file access, and networking using LSMs (AppArmor,
  SELinux, BPF-LSM) and eBPF, with rich alerts and telemetry.

overview: |
  **What it is** — KubeArmor provides runtime protection for Kubernetes workloads by enforcing security policies at the system level (process, file, network) and generating telemetry for visibility and response.

  **Highlights**
  - Policy enforcement via KubeArmorPolicy (workload) and KubeArmorHostPolicy (node/VM); block or audit actions
  - Uses LSMs (AppArmor, SELinux, BPF-LSM) and eBPF; no sidecar required
  - kArmor CLI and relay for logs/alerts; integrate with SIEM
  - Zero-trust least-permissive policies; protect service account tokens, block package managers, audit path access
