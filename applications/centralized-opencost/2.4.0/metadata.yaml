overview: |
  **What it is** — Centralized OpenCost runs the cost-collection backend on the management cluster without the UI, for environments where you run OpenCost with UI on each workload cluster.

  **Highlights**
  - Single cost backend on the management cluster; no OpenCost-to-OpenCost connection required
  - UI and per-cluster views remain on workload clusters
  - Same cost allocation and Prometheus integration as OpenCost
