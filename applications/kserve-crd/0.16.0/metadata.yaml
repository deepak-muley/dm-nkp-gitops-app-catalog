  Installs the KServe custom resource definitions (CRDs) only. Deploy this when
  you need InferenceService and related CRDs in the cluster without the full
  KServe control plane (e.g. for a shared cluster where KServe runs elsewhere).

overview: |
  **What it is** — This chart installs only the KServe CRDs (InferenceService, etc.) so that other KServe components or custom controllers can use them.

  **Highlights**
  - Lightweight: CRDs only, no controllers or runtime dependencies
  - Use when KServe control plane is installed separately or in another cluster
  - Version must match the KServe version that will use these CRDs
