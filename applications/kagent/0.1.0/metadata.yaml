overview: |
  **What it is** — Kagent is an operator that lets you run MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers on Kubernetes via the MCPServer CRD instead of managing Deployments and Services by hand.

  **Highlights**
  - MCPServer CRD for declarative MCP server management; auto-created RBAC and networking
  - Built-in Prometheus metrics and health endpoints; GitOps-friendly
  - CNCF Sandbox project; recommended for production MCP servers (e.g. dm-nkp-gitops-a2a-server in MCPServer mode)
