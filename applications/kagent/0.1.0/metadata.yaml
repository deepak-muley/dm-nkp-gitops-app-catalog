  Kagent is a CNCF Sandbox project that provides Kubernetes-native MCP (Model Context Protocol) 
  server deployment via MCPServer CRD. The Kagent operator manages MCP server lifecycles, 
  auto-creates Deployments, Services, and other resources, and provides built-in observability.
  
  This application installs the Kagent operator which enables:
  - MCPServer CRD for declarative MCP server management
  - Auto-managed RBAC, ServiceAccounts, and networking
  - Built-in metrics and health endpoints
  - GitOps-friendly CRD-based deployments
  
  After installation, you can deploy MCP servers using MCPServer CRD resources. This is the 
  recommended deployment mode for production MCP servers on NKP.
  
  Installation:
  - Installs Kagent operator in kagent-system namespace
  - Creates MCPServer CRD and related resources
  - No additional dependencies required
  
  Usage:
  After installation, set deploymentMode=mcpserver in MCP server Helm charts to use MCPServer CRD.
