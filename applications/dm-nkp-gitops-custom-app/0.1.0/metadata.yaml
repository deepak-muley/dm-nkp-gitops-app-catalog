description: |
  A production-ready Golang application with OpenTelemetry telemetry (metrics, logs, traces),
  designed for deployment in Nutanix NKP infrastructure. This application serves as a reference
  implementation for building cloud-native applications with comprehensive observability.
  
  Dependencies (install in order):
  1. cert-manager - for TLS certificate management (required for operator webhooks)
  2. letsencrypt-clusterissuer - for Let's Encrypt certificates (optional)
  3. traefik - for ingress routing (optional)
  4. kube-prometheus-stack (Prometheus + Grafana) - for metrics storage and visualization
  5. loki - for log aggregation
  6. tempo - for distributed tracing
  7. opentelemetry-operator - for managing OTel Collector via CRDs (recommended)
     OR opentelemetry-collector - standalone collector deployment (alternative)
  
  Note: The app connects to otel-collector:4317 for OTLP telemetry export.
  - With opentelemetry-operator: Deploy the included OpenTelemetryCollector CR named "otel"
  - With opentelemetry-collector: Uses the standalone collector service directly

overview: |
  dm-nkp-gitops-custom-app is a demo application demonstrating OpenTelemetry telemetry export 
  (metrics, logs, traces), health/readiness endpoints, and Kubernetes deployment with Helm.
  It integrates with the complete observability stack: OpenTelemetry Collector (managed by
  the OpenTelemetry Operator) receives telemetry via OTLP and forwards to Prometheus (metrics),
  Loki (logs), and Tempo (traces), all visualized in Grafana. Optionally integrates with 
  Traefik for ingress and cert-manager with Let's Encrypt for automatic TLS certificates.
