overview: |
  **What it is** — Loki is a log aggregation system that indexes by labels (like Prometheus) instead of full-text, making it efficient and easy to run at scale alongside Grafana.

  **Highlights**
  - LogQL for querying; native integration with Grafana for log exploration
  - OTLP log ingestion; compatible with OpenTelemetry Collector
  - Multi-tenant; stores data in object storage; part of the LGTM stack
  - Lower cost and operational burden than full-text indexing systems
